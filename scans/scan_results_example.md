   - Lists each vulnerability detected along with its severity level, description, and potential impact.

3. **Affected Hosts:**
   - Shows which hosts (IP addresses) are affected by specific vulnerabilities.

4. **Recommendations:**
   - Offers suggestions for remediation or mitigation of the vulnerabilities identified.

5. **Detailed Findings:**
   - Each vulnerability entry includes detailed information, such as:
